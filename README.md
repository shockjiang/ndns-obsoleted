WARNNING: This is an obsoleted implementation of NDNS, and will not be maintained any more. The only goal to keep the code here is to reserve the historical record.

NDNS: Domain Name Service for Named Data Networking
===================================================

NDNS is a completely distributed database system that largely mimics the structure of the
DNS system in today's Internet but operates within the NDN architecture.  Although the
design of NDNS was primarily driven with a desire to provide support for cryptographic key
distribution and routing scalability management, we believe that NDNS can also serve a
number of other purposes during the development and deployment of the NDN architecture in
coming years.



Now we have new design, and this one is out-dated. So we will not update code here any more.
